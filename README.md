24th September 2021
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The main goals are to create front end a Landing page, Sign-in page, Sign-Up page, Browsing Page of the Netflix website. This page is responsive to all devices.
APPROACH
Starting, I created a landing page consisting of a sign-in button, a sign-up button as getting started by providing email, advantages of using Netflix, FAQS regarding Netflix, and some helpful links for users.
The sign-in page asks users for user email or phone number, password, and sign-in button, browse button. If the user doesnâ€™t have an account, there will be a sign-up link to create an account.  When the user clicks on the browse button, it redirects to the browse page. At the bottom, it consists of useful links for users.
The sign-up page asks users their first name, email, phone, pass, password and, sign-up button. If the user is an existing user, there will be a link to the sign-in page. At the bottom, it consists of useful links for users.
The browse page has the featured movie with a movie background image and a short description of the movie and play button. There are two genres of movie images with slide shows. By pressing the right and left buttons, the user can go to the next slide; when the user places the cursor on pictures of movies, the image size increases. If the user clicks on it, a special box opens consists of a unique image of that movie as background, movie title, a short description of that movie, a play button, and a cross mark. Whenever the user clicks on the cross mark, opened movie box will be closed. When the user clicks on the play button, the whole page turns into an overlay, and a video will start playing. The carrier will come to the usual form if the user clicks anywhere except on video. Finally, at the bottom, it consists of useful links for users.
Whenever the user clicks on the Netflix logo, it redirects to the landing page.
